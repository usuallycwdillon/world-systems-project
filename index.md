I am a PhD student in the Department of Computational Social Sciences, at the Krasnow Institute for Advanced Studies. We focus our research on understanding complex adaptive social systems from a behavioral (even cognitive) perspective. This seminar, by Dr. Claudio Cioffi-Revilla focuses on models of conflict: statistical models, games and decision models, dynamic models and agent-based models, for example.

### Getting More from War Data 

* Correlates of War (COW) data is some of the most comprehensive data about conflicts 
 - curated, reviewed, validated 
 - covers the period 1820-current
* Analysis of COW data has been mostly via regression models

--- &vertical

### World-Systems Analysis

* Quantitative approach to world history 
* Divides the international political economy worlds: 
 - core ($1^{st}$ world)
 - semi-periphery ($2^{nd}$ world)
 - periphery ($3^{rd}$ world)
* Often applied in conjunction with "dependence theory" to explain differing development rates around the world


***

### World-Systems and Conflict

* Dependence theory interprets world-systems analysis as evidence of global class struggles, ala Marx
 - core exploits the periphery
 - chains of economic development
* Root cause of conflict is undefended wealth

***

### Scholarship 

* Immanuel Wallerstein
 - First published on world-systems analysis in 1974
 - _Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century_
 - multi-cultural territorial division of labor
* Frank & Gills
 - anthropoligists
 - widened concept to study development patterns back to Mesopotamia
 
*** 

### Data

* COW data easily had
* world-systems network data seems impossible to find
 - hot on the trail
 - might be re-created with published methods
 - ...but I don't want to do that work, too

--- &vertical

### Project

* Build on the structural interpretation of world-systems analyis
 - Haas
 - Russett
* Review previous methods of analysing conflict
 - Richardson
 - Cioffi-Revilla
* Expand the utility of COW
 - Spatial
 - Structural
